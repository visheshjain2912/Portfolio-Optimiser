## Portfolio Optimisation

### Optimise Maximum Sharpe Ratio

* Sharpe Ratio basically tells us about how much access returns can we get for some extra amount of volatility/risk.

* It basically measures the performance of a risky investment and compares it to the performance of a risk-free investment.

## Conclusion:
* By taking less risk and being impartial towards every stock in our portfolio, we will get a good annual return.

* But, by optimising the portfolio using Sharpe Ratio, we can see that taking a little bit of more risk can give us better annual return.

* We also come to know about what percentage of our money should we invest in a particular stock to get those better results.
